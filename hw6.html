<h5>Answers:</h5>
<p>1.Javascript Browser Sniffer is a browser identifier written in JavaScript. It will tell which browser, version and operating system
    the visitor(or user) are using.</p>
<p>2.It is because identifying the browser and its version is of great importance in web development. Different browsers may lead to various
     JavaScript programs to implement the same function, so knowing nothing about the browser and its version is dangerous while developing in JavaScript</p>
